# ecommerce-back-end

The Ecommerce Back-end project is a Node.js, Express, Sequalize, Mysql and RESTful API focused project requiring the use of the Express, Mysql2, Sequelize, and Dotenv packages. The app utilizes sequelize to perform SQL queries to GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE database a product database. The App is initialized in a terminal using the command "npm start". When the App starts, the user must use Insomnia to make requests to view data or make changes to data in the ecommerce database. The user can view all products, categories, and product tags by making a GET request to the /products, /categories, and /tags routes. The user can also view individual categories, products, and tags and also create, make updates to, or delete individual categories, products, or tags.
